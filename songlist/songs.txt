A Wolf at the Door
Radiohead
2004
Drag him out your window, Dragging out the dead, Singing I miss you, Snakes and ladders flip the lid, Out pops the cracker, Smacks you in the head, Knives you in the neck, Kicks you in the teeth, Steel toe caps, Takes all your credit cards, Get up get the gunge, Get the eggs, Get the flan in the face, The flan in the face, The flan in the face, Dance you fucker dance you fucker, Don't you dare, Don't you dare, Don't you flan in the face, Take it with the love its given, Take it with a pinch of salt, Take it to the tax man, Let me back, Let me back, I promise to be good, Don't look in the mirror at the face you don't recognize, Help me,  call the doctor,  put me inside, Put me inside, Put me inside, Put me inside, Put me inside, I keep the wolf from the door, But he calls me up, Calls me on the phone, Tells me all the ways that he's gonna mess me up, Steal all my children if I don't pay the ransom, And I'll never see them again if I squeal to the cops, Walking like giant cranes, And with my X-ray eyes I strip you naked, In a tight little world, And are you on the list?, Stepford wives who are we to complain?, Investments and dealers, Investments and dealers, Cold wives and mistresses, Cold wives and Sunday papers city, Boys in first class don't know we're born just know, Someone else is gonna come and clean it up, Born and raised for the job, Someone always does, I wish you'd get up get over, Get up get over and turn the tape off, I keep the wolf from the door, But he calls me up, Calls me on the phone, Tells me all the ways that he's gonna mess me up, Steal all my children if I don't pay the ransom, And I'll never see them again if I squeal to the cops, So I'm just gonna

Woo-hoo, Woo-hoo, Woo-hoo, Woo-hoo, I got my head checked, By a jumbo jet, It wasn't easy, But nothing is, No, When I feel heavy metal, (Woo-hoo) And I'm pins and I'm needles, (Woo-hoo) Well,  I lie and I'm easy, All of the time but I'm never sure why I need you, Pleased to meet you, I got my head done, When I was young, It's not my problem, It's not my problem, When I feel heavy metal, (Woo-hoo) And I'm pins and I'm needles, (Woo-hoo) Well,  I lie and I'm easy, All of the time but I'm never sure why I need you, Pleased to meet you, Yeah,  yeah, Yeah,  yeah, Yeah,  yeah, Oh,  yeah

Coming out of my cage, And I've been doing just fine, Gotta gotta be down, Because I want it all, It started out with a kiss, How did it end up like this?, It was only a kiss,  it was only a kiss, Now I'm falling asleep, And she's calling a cab, While he's having a smoke, And she's taking a drag, Now they're going to bed, And my stomach is sick, And it's all in my head, But she's touching his chest now, He takes off her dress now, Let me go, And I just can't look,  it's killing me, And taking control, Jealousy,  turning saints into the sea, Swimming through sick lullabies, Choking on your alibis, But it's just the price I pay, Destiny is calling me, Open up my eager eyes, 'Cause I'm Mr. Brightside, I'm coming out of my cage, And I've been doing just fine, Gotta gotta be down, Because I want it all, It started out with a kiss, How did it end up like this?, (It was only a kiss),  it was only a kiss, Now I'm falling asleep, And she's calling a cab, While he's having a smoke, And she's taking a drag, Now they're going to bed, And my stomach is sick, And it's all in my head, But she's touching his chest now, He takes off her dress now, Let me go, 'Cause I just can't look,  it's killing me, And taking control, Jealousy,  turning saints into the sea, Swimming through sick lullabies, Choking on your alibi, But it's just the price I pay, Destiny is calling me, Open up my eager eyes, 'Cause I'm Mr. Brightside, I never, I never, I never, I never
